# Java Development Diary

This repository documents my 100-day journey of advancing from a novice to an expert in Java. 
It captures my daily progress, challenges faced, and the solutions I developed. 
The projects build upon each other, emphasizing core Java concepts such as 
Object-Oriented Programming, network programming, databases, and more. This repository starts from Day 3 because this is when the topics being revisted 
or newly learned build on top of each other

## Day 3: Introduction to Classes and Objects

**Objective:** Grasp the fundamentals of classes and objects in Java, focusing on constructors, methods, and the principles of encapsulation.

### Challenge Summary
- Created a `Person` class with `name`, `age`, and `favoriteColor` fields.
- Implemented methods within the `Person` class to introduce the person and celebrate their birthday.
- Explored how objects of the `Person` class can interact with these methods.

### Key Concepts
- **Classes and Objects:** The backbone of Java's OOP model, allowing for the creation of custom data types with both state and behavior.
- **Encapsulation:** Demonstrated by making `Person` class fields private and interacting with them through public methods.

## Day 4: Inheritance and Interfaces

**Objective:** Dive deeper into OOP with inheritance and interfaces, understanding their role in polymorphism and code reuse.

### Challenge Summary
- Extended the `Person` class with a `Student` subclass, adding `studentId` and `major` fields.
- Implemented the `Learner` interface with a `study()` method, adopted by the `Student` class.

### Key Concepts
- **Inheritance:** Allows a class to inherit fields and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.
- **Interfaces:** Defines a contract for classes, ensuring they provide implementations for certain behaviors.

## Day 5: Collections Framework

**Objective:** Learn to utilize Java's Collections Framework for storing, retrieving, and manipulating data.

### Challenge Summary
- Utilized `ArrayList` to manage a dynamic array of `Person` objects.
- Explored `HashSet` for unique collections of courses.
- Implemented `HashMap` to map students' names to their course lists.

### Key Concepts
- **List, Set, Map:** Core interfaces of the Collections Framework, each serving distinct data management purposes.
- **Generics:** Enabled type-safe collections, ensuring compile-time safety for collection elements.
